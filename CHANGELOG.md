## 2.2.0

### Important Changes

- **fix(browser): Ensure IP address is only inferred by Relay if `sendDefaultPii` is `true`** ([#957](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-capacitor/pull/957))

This release includes a fix for a [behaviour change](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/migration/v8-to-v9/#behavior-changes)
that was originally introduced with v9 of the JavaScript SDK: User IP Addresses should only be added to Sentry events automatically,
if `sendDefaultPii` was set to `true`.

However, the change in v9 required further internal adjustment, which should have been included in v10 of the SDK.
To avoid making a major bump, the fix was patched on the current version and not by bumping to V10.
There is _no API_ breakage involved and hence it is safe to update.
However, after updating the SDK, events (errors, traces, replays, etc.) sent from the browser, will only include
user IP addresses, if you set `sendDefaultPii: true` in your `Sentry.init` options.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused!

## 1.0.0

### How to Upgrade to Version 1:

- Angular minimum supported version changed to version 14, upgrade to Angular 14 or higher for using the latest SDK.

- When using the package `@sentry/angular-ivy`, you will need to replace it by `@sentry/angular`.

- `enableOutOfMemoryTracking` was removed and replaced by `enableWatchdogTerminationTracking`.

- This release bumps the dependency for the JavaScript SDK from v7 to v8. We recommend reading the
  [migration guide docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/migration/v0-to-v1/) to find out
  how to address any breaking changes in your code for your specific platform or framework.

To automate upgrading to v8 as much as possible, use our migration codemod `@sentry/migr8`:

```sh
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

All deprecations from the v7 cycle, with the exception of `getCurrentHub()`, have been removed and can no longer be used
in v8. If you have an advanced Sentry SDK setup, we additionally recommend reading the
[in-depth migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/migration/v0-to-v1/v7-to-v8/#upgrading-to-8x) in our repo which highlights all changes with additional details and
information.
